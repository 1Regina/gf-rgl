--2 Clauses

-- The $NP VP$ predication rule form a clause whose linearization
-- gives a table of all tense variants, positive and negative.
-- Clauses are converted to $S$ (with fixed tense) with the
-- $UseCl$ function below.

  data
    PredVP    : NP -> VP -> Cl ;         -- John walks

-- Using an embedded sentence as a subject is treated separately.
-- This can be overgenerating. E.g. "whether you go" as subject
-- is only meaningful for some verb phrases.

    PredSCVP  : SC -> VP -> Cl ;         -- that she goes is good

--2 Clauses missing object noun phrases

-- This category is a variant of the 'slash category' $S/NP$ of
-- GPSG and categorial grammars, which in turn replaces
-- movement transformations in the formation of questions
-- and relative clauses. Except $SlashV2$, the construction 
-- rules can be seen as special cases of function composition, in
-- the style of CCG.
-- *Note* the set is not complete and lacks e.g. verbs with more than 2 places.

    SlashVP   : NP -> VPSlash -> ClSlash ;      -- (whom) he sees
    AdvSlash  : ClSlash -> Adv -> ClSlash ;     -- (whom) he sees today
    SlashPrep : Cl -> Prep -> ClSlash ;         -- (with whom) he walks 
    SlashVS   : NP -> VS -> SSlash -> ClSlash ; -- (whom) she says that he loves

--2 Imperatives

-- An imperative is straightforwardly formed from a verb phrase.
-- It has variation over positive and negative, singular and plural.
-- To fix these parameters, see [Phrase Phrase.html].

    ImpVP     : VP -> Imp ;              -- love yourselves

--2 Embedded sentences

-- Sentences, questions, and infinitival phrases can be used as
-- subjects and (adverbial) complements.

    EmbedS    : S  -> SC ;               -- that she goes
    EmbedQS   : QS -> SC ;               -- who goes
    EmbedVP   : VP -> SC ;               -- to go

--2 Sentences

-- These are the 2 x 4 x 4 = 16 forms generated by different
-- combinations of tense, polarity, and
-- anteriority, which are defined in [``Common`` Common.html].

  fun
    UseCl    : Temp -> Pol -> Cl  -> S ;   -- she had not slept
    UseQCl   : Temp -> Pol -> QCl -> QS ;  -- who had not slept
    UseRCl   : Temp -> Pol -> RCl -> RS ;  -- that had not slept
    UseSlash : Temp -> Pol -> ClSlash -> SSlash ; -- (that) she had not seen

-- An adverb can be added to the beginning of a sentence, either with comma ("externally")
-- or without:

    AdvS     : Adv -> S  -> S ;            -- then I will go home
    ExtAdvS  : Adv -> S  -> S ;            -- next week, I will go home

-- This covers subjunctive clauses, but they can also be added to the end.

    SSubjS   : S -> Subj -> S -> S ;       -- I go home if she comes

-- A sentence can be modified by a relative clause referring to its contents.

    RelS     : S -> RS -> S ;              -- she sleeps, which is good

---- A sentence can also be post-modified by a subjunct sentence.

----    ModSubjS : S -> Subj -> S -> S ;       -- she sleeps, because she is old 
---- cf. Adverb.SubjS

--.

-- Examples for English $S$/$Cl$:

  Pres  Simul  Pos  ODir  : he sleeps
  Pres  Simul  Neg  ODir  : he doesn't sleep
  Pres  Anter  Pos  ODir  : he has slept
  Pres  Anter  Neg  ODir  : he hasn't slept
  Past  Simul  Pos  ODir  : he slept
  Past  Simul  Neg  ODir  : he didn't sleep
  Past  Anter  Pos  ODir  : he had slept
  Past  Anter  Neg  ODir  : he hadn't slept
  Fut   Simul  Pos  ODir  : he will sleep
  Fut   Simul  Neg  ODir  : he won't sleep
  Fut   Anter  Pos  ODir  : he will have slept
  Fut   Anter  Neg  ODir  : he won't have slept
  Cond  Simul  Pos  ODir  : he would sleep
  Cond  Simul  Neg  ODir  : he wouldn't sleep
